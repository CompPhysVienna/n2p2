.. n2p2 - A neural network potential package documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Tue Jan 29 14:37:49 2019.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the documentation of n2p2!
=====================================

This repository (obtain source code `here
<https://github.com/CompPhysVienna/n2p2>`__) provides ready-to-use software for
high-dimensional neural network potentials in computational physics and
chemistry.  The methodology behind the Behler-Parinello neural network
potentials was first described here:

`J. Behler and M. Parrinello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 146401 (2007)
<https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.146401>`__

This package contains software that will allow you to use existing neural
network potential parameterizations to predict energies and forces (with
standalone tools but also in conjunction with the MD software `LAMMPS
<http://lammps.sandia.gov>`__). In addition it is possible to train new neural
network potentials with the provided training tools.

Documentation
=============

.. danger::

   The build process has changed recently, please have a look at the :ref:`build
   instructions <build>`!

.. warning::

   Unfortunately many parts of the documentation are still unfinished and will
   be completed little by little. If you have specific questions, consider to
   ask on GitHub (file an issue) and I will update the corresponding docs as
   quickly as possible.

This package uses automatic documentation generation via `Doxygen
<http://www.doxygen.nl>`__ and `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__. An online
version of the documentation which is automatically updated with the main
repository can be found `here <https://compphysvienna.github.io/n2p2>`__.

API documentation
-----------------

Most parts of the C++ code are documented in the header files via Doxygen
annotations. The information written in the source files is automatically
extracted by `Doxygen` and presented in a separate API documentation page
available `here <doxygen/index.html>`__.

.. documentation (see `API` section on the left). However, because
.. this documentation and also `Exhale` is still under development some things may
.. not work as expected. As a fallback option the unaltered Doxygen API
.. documentation is also available `here <doxygen/index.html>`__.

Purpose
=======

This repository provides applications for multiple purposes. Depending on your
task at hand you may only need individual parts and do not need to compile all
components (see components table below). As a new user you may find yourself in
one of these three possible scenarios:

Prediction with existing neural network potential
-------------------------------------------------

If you have a working neural network potential setup (i.e. a settings file with
network and symmetry function parameters, weight files and a scaling file)
ready and want to predict energies and forces for a single structure you only
need these components:

* :ref:`libnnp <libnnp>`
* :ref:`nnp-predict`

Molecular dynamics simulation
-----------------------------

Similarly, if you have a working neural network potential setup and would like
to run an MD simulation with an external MD software (so far only LAMMPS is
supported), these components are required:

* :ref:`libnnp <libnnp>`
* `libnnpif`
* :ref:`lammps-nnp <if_lammps>`

Training a new neural network potential
---------------------------------------

To train a completely new neural network potential the following parts are required:

* :ref:`libnnp <libnnp>`
* `libnnptrain`
* :ref:`nnp-scaling`
* :ref:`nnp-train`

Additional, though not strictly required tools, are also quite useful:

* `nnp-comp2`
* :ref:`nnp-convert`
* `nnp-dataset`
* `nnp-dist`
* :ref:`nnp-norm`
* :ref:`nnp-prune`
* :ref:`nnp-select`
* `nnp-symfunc`

Rough guidelines for NNP training are provided [here](training.md).

Examples
========

Applications
------------

Minimal working examples for each application can be found in the corresponding
subdirectory in ``examples``, e.g. ``examples/nnp-train``.

Training data sets and single configurations (for testing)
----------------------------------------------------------

Small data sets for testing purposes can be found in
``examples/configuration-sets`` and single configurations are provided in
``configuration-single``.

Training data sets (full size)
------------------------------
Actual full size data sets may be rather large and are therefore hosted elsewhere:

+-------------+--------------+
| System      | Link         |
+=============+==============+
| |H2O| [1]_  | |h2o_data|_  |
+-------------+--------------+
| |Cu2S| [2]_ | |cu2s_data|_ |
+-------------+--------------+

NNP potentials ready for use
----------------------------

Working pre-trained NNP potentials are located in ``examples/potentials``.


Keywords
========

The setup of a neural network potential (network topology, symmetry function
parameters,...) is stored in a simple text file with keyword-argument pairs. A
list of keywords is provided :ref:`here <keywords>`.
