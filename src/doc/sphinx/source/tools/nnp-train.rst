This tool implements the actual training procedure for a given data set. It is
able to train both 2G and 4G neural networks (NN). In the latter case the
training procedure consists of stage 1 and 2.

Requirements:
-------------
* ``input.data``
* ``input.nn``
* ``scaling.data``

Additionally for stage 2 in the 4G case:

* ``hardness.???.data``
* ``weightse.???.data``

Usage:
-----------

When training a 2G NN the following command will train a NN with the given
topology in ``input.nn`` for the given data set with 4 MPI tasks

.. code-block:: none

   mpirun -np 4 nnp-train

If one has specified a 4G NN the command is

.. code-block:: none

   mpirun -np 4 nnp-train <n>

where ``<n>`` is the stage (1 or 2).

Sample screen output:
---------------------

A typical stage 1 training with a 4G network looks like this:

.. code-block:: none
